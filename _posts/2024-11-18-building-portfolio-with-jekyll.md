Creating a personal portfolio website is an excellent way to showcase your projects and skills. In this post, I'll share my experience building this portfolio site using Jekyll, a static site generator.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll offers several advantages for a portfolio site:

- **Simplicity**: No database required, just markdown files
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with automatic deployment
- **Customization**: Full control over design and functionality
- **Performance**: Static sites are fast and secure
- **Markdown**: Write content in a simple, readable format

## Project Structure

The site is organized into several key components:

- **_config.yml**: Main configuration file
- **_layouts**: HTML templates for different page types
- **_projects**: Collection of project descriptions
- **_posts**: Blog posts (like this one!)
- **assets**: CSS, images, and JavaScript

## Key Features

### Project Showcase
The projects section uses Jekyll collections to organize and display projects by category (robotics, software engineering, machine learning) and type (personal vs. team projects).

### Responsive Design
The site uses CSS flexbox and grid for a responsive layout that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### Easy Maintenance
Adding a new project is as simple as creating a new markdown file in the `_projects` directory with appropriate front matter.

## Next Steps

I plan to continue enhancing the site with:
- Project filtering by technology stack
- Case study deep-dives
- Technical blog posts
- Performance optimizations

Stay tuned for more updates!
